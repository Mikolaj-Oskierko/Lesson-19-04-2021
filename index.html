			<p>Links can go from regular to visited. You can hover over things. You can focus. What if you want to actually have a bit of almost animation when you do these things?
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="content2">
			<p>If you hover over the link, you can change the color. If an image comes into focus, you can change the size. These things gives you bit of cool factor that you've been looking for.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="content3">
			<p>If you want to add transitions to your page, there's four properties. First is the transition property. What is it that you want to change? The size, the color, the position?</p>
		</div>
		<div class="content4">
			<p>What about duration? How long should transition last? They can happen very quickly, where people almost don't even notice it, or it can be really long.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="content5">
			<p>If you're going to make something bigger, do you want to make it slowly bigger and linear all at the same time or do you want it to ease in or ease out?</p> 
			<p>Transition delay is, should the browser wait before it starts transition? When people are looking at your page, they've just got the mouse going all over. You don't want to have them looking at the transitions unless they need to be focusing on that element. If you want to use transitions, the first thing you need to do is to define element and say what style you want it to have when you load the page.</p>
